# Study books (`db/books/<book>/*.json`)

Textbook-style chapters ("Learn like a book"). One JSON file per chapter, e.g.
`db/books/history/ch02-harappan.json`. Loaded by `src/services/books.js`, checked by
`src/services/books.validate.js`, and served at `/books/:book`. The chapter's practice questions
are seeded into the ordinary question bank by `scripts/seedBooks.js`, so practice, custom tests, the mistake
book and revision work with them.

Plan and owner decisions: `docs/HISTORY_BOOK_PLAN.md`.

## Language

**All student-facing text is Bengali only** (owner decision of 2026-11-11). Standard West Bengal Bengali, as in
WBPSC papers and WBBSE textbooks; Bengali digits (১৯০৫); the established Bengali names of people and places. A
technical term may carry the English in brackets once: `দুর্গ (Citadel)`.
The internal claims sheet (`claims[]`) is in English, because it quotes the English NCERT text.

Text fields are Markdown strings (bold, lists, simple tables). No HTML.

## Sources

Two official textbook sources only (owner decisions of 2026-11-11):

1. **NCERT textbooks** (`https://ncert.nic.in/textbook/pdf/…`): the all-India foundation.
2. **WBBSE / Banglar Shiksha e-Text Books** (`https://banglarshiksha.wb.gov.in/readwrite/etextbook/…`, listed at
   banglarshiksha.wb.gov.in → E-Text Book, Bengali medium; History is *অতীত ও ঐতিহ্য*, Classes VII–VIII; Geography
   is *আমাদের পৃথিবী*, VI–VIII): the West Bengal-specific foundation. Use them first for Bengal history, Bengal
   personalities and the Bengali names and terms students meet at school. Quotes from these books are in Bengali.

Every date, name, number, place and causal claim in the chapter must be in `claims[]` with a verbatim quote from one
of these books. A detail that neither supports is left out. It is never written from memory. Where the books disagree with each other (NCERT vs NCERT, or NCERT vs WBBSE), or with the usual "exam answer", say so
in an `exam_note` box, quoting both.

The text is written in our own words: explain, do not translate NCERT paragraphs.

## Rules (enforced by the validator)

- Every section has `quick` and `standard`; `deep` is optional. 4-8 sections.
- Every `section` reference (events, people, terms, cause_effect, exam_focus, questions) names an existing section.
- Every `claims` reference names an existing claim; every claim names an existing source with an https NCERT URL,
  and has a non-empty quote.
- Questions: exactly 4 distinct options, exactly one correct, ids unique, with at least 30 questions and every level
  present. STATEMENT and MATCH options follow the formats in `db/gk/README.md`.
- A question's distractors must be definitely wrong according to the claims. "All of the above" and "None of these" are not allowed.
- `status: PUBLISHED` requires `verification.status: VERIFIED`. Questions reach students only from a PUBLISHED chapter.
